Hi friends,


This is ravinder karnati
As a developers we need to use versioning control system to know what code we added latestly and what is the current version and everyting
should be centrelized, so that other team memebers can get your updated code and they can work

We can maintain working code in stable or major version, we can take or create new branch from existing branch and we can add code to 
that new branch,once if it works fine then we can merge it with stable version

I hope this will help you friends

Regards

Ravinder Karnati
